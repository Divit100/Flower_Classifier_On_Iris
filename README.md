# Flower_Classifier_On_Iris

In this project,using the IRIS dataset,I created a model that would predict the type of flower (Verginica,Setosa,Versicolor) given parameters of sepal_length	sepal_width	petal_length	petal_width.After training the model on 400 epochs ,I was able to get an accuracy of 91% and 86% on validation data.
